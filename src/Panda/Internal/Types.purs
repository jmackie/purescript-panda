-- | A static component is one that has properties and potentially houses other
-- components. These are the things you _actually_ render to the DOM, and get
-- converted to HTML elements. Note that the children of a static component can
-- absolutely be dynamic, and it can even have dynamic properties. All this
-- represents is an HTML element.

-- | A watcher component is one that varies according to the state and updates
-- in the application loop. Because a re-render is a destructive process, it is
-- recommended that the more common the watcher's interest, the lower in the
-- component tree it should occur. If an event is likely to be fired every
-- second and that will cause the re-rendering of the entire tree, performance
-- won't be great. Similarly to the `PropertyWatcher`, the `interest` flag is
-- an indication to the renderer: it may be ignored, as is the case in the
-- initial render.

-- Applications can be nested arbitrarily, with the proviso that there is some
-- way to translate from "parent" to "child". The actual types of the child are

-- events from the child, I can embed this application".
